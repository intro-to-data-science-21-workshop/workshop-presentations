# Workshop presentations

Please publish your presentation materials in a repo that you create in our workshop organization at https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop. There's a naming convention for the repos, which should indicate the order that you presented, your name (one group member only), and a very brief description, all separated by dashes. E.g.: `01-FirstnameLastname-Topic/`.

## R Markdown

Please try to make your presentations using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). You can use any one of the multiple slide deck options. (For what it's worth, I use the [xaringan package with a modified metropolis theme](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes) for my lecture slides). Or you can output as a [GitHub document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) or [HTML document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html). If you choose the latter, I would request that you please include `keep_md: true` in your YAML, so that it is readable directly on GitHub.

## Recording

There are multiple ways to record your computer screen and voice for the presentation videos. You can [record MS PowerPoint with audio and video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m60HT3OMOI), [record a presentation on Zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cTbnUPwfY), [record a presentation via MS Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymnTVklGtAY), or use [open source software OBS Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKgM18lOsr4). Just make sure the `format is mp4` and the entire thing is `no longer than 15 minutes`! If you need to convert between video formats, I recommend the open source video transcoder [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/). For minimal cutting you might want to use lightweight [LosslessCut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut).


## Topics

Topics will be randomly allocated to groups of 2 students. Both of you should contribute to both the presentation and the practice session, but you can divide main responsibilities.
